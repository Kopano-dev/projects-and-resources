# Contribution Guidelines
Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Listings in the [README](README.md) should be for SugarCE only. 
* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Please make an individual commit for each listing in a pull request.
* Put a link to each library in your pull request ticket, so they're easier to look at.
* There should be no code, e.g. zip files, in the pull request (or the repository itself). This is information and listing purposes only. 
* Use the following format for libraries: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* All listings within a category should be alphabetical. 
* Keep descriptions short and simple. 
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you!
